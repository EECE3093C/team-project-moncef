# MonCal

***DRAFT***

MonCal is a **Centralized Calendar Management Desktop Application** that integrates with popular calendar platforms, such as Gmail, Outlook, and Apple, using APIs. The application will allow users to view all their calendar events in a centralized hub and create new events with advanced scheduling options, such as weekly repetition or custom recurrence patterns.

The project's goal is to simplify calendar management for users who use multiple calendar platforms. Currently, users who have multiple calendars often have to switch between different platforms and applications to view their events, leading to a disjointed and confusing experience. MonCal will eliminate this issue by providing users with a single, unified view of their calendar events.

The application will be developed using popular programming languages and technologies, such as C#/C++, and will incorporate a user-friendly interface to make it easy for users to interact with their calendar data. The application will also use APIs from popular calendar platforms to access and manage calendar data, allowing users to easily connect their calendars to the application.

We are planning on adding features such as:
- User interface customization
- Collaboration tools: tools for users to collaborate with others, such as the ability to share calendars and events with friends, family, or colleagues.
- Adding assignment due dates/deadlines to calendars
- Ability to create an event for colloborating on a project/assignment that links to a specified document on Google Drive/OneDrive
